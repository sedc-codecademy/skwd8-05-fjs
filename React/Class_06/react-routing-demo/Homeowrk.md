## Homework

- From previous homework for deleting product card from UI, if you have implemented "delete product by id" endpoint, implement
  it by deleting the product in database, else delete it in FE by ID.
- Add new item in Nav "Add product" where by clicking it you will be navigated to new route "/create" where form should be rendered.
  In this form user will need to add informations about the product that he wants to add in products. When submiting the form, the new product
  should be added in products (do this in database if you have endpoint for creating new product, else in FE) and after that you should be navigated to 
  "/products" where we are showing all products, but this time the knew product should be shown as well.
