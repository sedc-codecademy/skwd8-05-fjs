#Create component called Radio button that will render only one radio button, include same component in a parent one using ViewChild, and when
some of the radio buttons is clicked (in child component) update parent component with the info of which radio button is clicked, while also
reset (unclick) other radio buttons from other child components

#Each radio button should bring different filter for DatePipe, where once you click on a radio button it will filter the date by following formats:
"dd-MM-yyyy", "yyyy-MM-dd", "HH:mm",  "HH:mm:ss", "dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm"
