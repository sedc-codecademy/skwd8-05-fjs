Using readline, offer to the user option to :

1. Create new folder inside the workspace directory, and provide a name for the folder.
2. Create new file in the folder by specifying the name and file extension.
3. List the files/folders inside the folder by given path. e.g workspace/dirname1

For the operations such file read/create, folder read/create, create new module, that will have all FS related functions, and trigger those functions by using event emitter from main file.

readline.question('Select option: 1,2,3...', (answer) => {
	event.emit({option: answer});
});
