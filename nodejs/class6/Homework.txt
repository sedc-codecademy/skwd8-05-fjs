Homework

Create a quiz.

The quiz should provide to user a page where user can enter its name and start with the quiz. At the time user should see only one question, after answering the question user should go to next question. Each question should have 4 pre-defined answers which will be with radio button. Each question can have only one valid answer. 

The quiz should have minimum 5 questions.

1. Create HTTP server using Express
2. Add support for static files to be served (the site which will be seen be the users)
3. Add session to the server.
4. Add session middleware where you will keep track which question is displayed at the moment, and the answers to the previous questions.
5. Create route for get question.
6. List with all questions (JSON) should be keep in a file. Once you make request to the get question route you should load the json from file, and return the question with possible answers back.
7. Create route for answer question, where when called, answer will be stored in session, and positive response will be returned back, once response is received on FE, FE should call get question route (step 5)
8. When there are no more questions to answer, there should be end quiz route, that will be called from FE (Frontend) and as response here you will return all the answers from the session, that user had put, and correct answers to each of it.

9. On frontend you should build simple UI, where you will need to display the question text with radio buttons for answers and buttons for taking action (answer question, end quiz etc)
