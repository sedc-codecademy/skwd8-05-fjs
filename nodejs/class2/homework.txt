Homework,

Using FS and Path open existing directory on your computer e.g C:\Users or any other,
then use scan dir to get all the dirs and files, and in console print the dirs first by alphabetical order, then print the files after also in alphabetical order.

Bonus:

Using promopt to ask the user for path (dir) to be scanned, once the user enters the path, then scan the dir as previously.
